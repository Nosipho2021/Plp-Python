# 🔁 Loop-Based Calculator

## 📌 Description

This is an enhanced Python calculator that uses **loops** and **conditional logic** to allow users to perform multiple arithmetic operations without restarting the program. It supports basic arithmetic operations and continues to prompt the user until they choose to exit.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice using `while` loops and conditional (`if/elif/else`) statements.
- Repeatedly handle user input for numbers and operations.
- Provide clean error handling and input validation.
- Allow users to perform multiple calculations in one session.
